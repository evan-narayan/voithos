# Voithos
## A private cloud helper by Breqwatr

Voithos is a command-line toolkit used to deploy and manage the various services and
utilities that make up private clouds.

While this project is created and Managed by Breqwatr, it's open source and free for
anyone to use.

Voithos was formerly known as the Breqwatr Deployment Tool.


## Installation & Requirements

they do. In practice, it is tested against Mac OSX and Ubuntu Server 18.04.

To install Voithos, check out the git project and use pip in a virtualenv.

On Ubuntu:

```bash
# Install Docker

add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce

# Install python3
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip virtualenv

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/breqwatr/voithos.git
cd voithos

# Create and source the virtualenv
