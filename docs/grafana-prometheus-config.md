# Grafana and Prometheus Configurations

## SMTP Configuration
SMTP configuration is needed to setup email alerts through Grafana. Put these configs in
`/etc/kolla/grafana/grafana.ini` on all the servers on which grafana containers are running
and restart those containers using `docker restart grafana`.
```yaml
[smtp]                                                           
enabled =true                   
host = <host:port>
user = <user>
# If the password contains # or ; you have to wrap it with triple quotes. Ex """#password;"""
password = <password>                 
cert_file =                                        
key_file =
skip_verify = false                                                                                                     
from_address = <email address for sending alerts>
from_name = Grafana
# EHLO identity in SMTP dialog (defaults to instance_name)
ehlo_identity =  
```

## Grafana Domain Configuration
Kolla-ansible doesn't configure domain address by default. So when we get an alert through email,
it has a tab that should redirect to grafana alert webui address. If the domain isn't configured,
it will redirect to `localhost:3000` instead of `grafana-webui-ip:3000`. In order to configure that
open `/etc/kolla/grafana/grafana.ini` and put `domain = <api_interface_address>` under `[server]`.
`<api_interface_address>` will be same as `http_addr` configured under `[server]`. Do this on all
the servers on which grafana containers are running and restart containers using
`docker restart grafana`.

## Prometheus Scrape interval
Scrape interval is time period after which an exporter collects data. Lower scrape interval can
put stress on resources. By default it collects data after every one minute. One way of changing
 it is to configure a custom `prometheus.yml` before deployment in
`OpenStack Service Configuration` step. For changing `scrape_interval` after deployment, open
`/etc/kolla/prometheus-server/prometheus.yml`. Change the value of `scrape_interval` under
`global` and under `scrape_configs` if any of the exporter has `scrape_interval` variable defined.


## TLS Configuration
If tls is enabled in your deployment then add `verify: false` under `default` in
`/etc/kolla/prometheus-openstack-exporter/clouds.yml` and restart prometheus_openstack_exporter
container using `docker restart prometheus_openstack_exporter`

## Access Grafana Webui
Access grafana webui using `<external-vip>:3000` or `<internal-vip>:3000`. Username is `admin` and
it's password can be found by running `cat /etc/kolla/grafana/grafana.ini | grep admin_password`

## Invite Users
* Hover over `Configuration` symbol (2nd last symbol) on the left hand side and click on `Users`.
* On the right side, click on `Invite` button.
* Fill the forms and click on submit.
**Note**: It will fail if smtp isn't configured.

## Create Notification Channel
**Note:** Skip this section if you don't want to setup alerts.
For setting up email alert, first we have to create a notification channel
* Hover over `Alerting` symbol (4th symbol) on the left hand side and click on 
`Notification channels`.
* Click on `Add Channel` button.
* Add the name of channel.
* Enable `Default` if you want to add this channel to all alerts.
* Add comma separated email addresses.
* Click on `Send Test` and save if it sends a test email.

**Note**: If you will be creating graphs and alerts using a voithos command, create a
default notification channel to which all the script created alerts will be sent.
